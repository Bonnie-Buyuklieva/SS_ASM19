## Who are we looking for?
We are looking for enthusiastic PhD students who would like to learn new quantitative spatial analysis techniques, share their own methods and techniques with others, and work collaboratively to apply these techniques to interesting datasets.

Our hope is to bring together early stage PhD students working on diverse research questions involving some aspect of quantitative spatial analysis. We will be covering many topics in a short amount of time and some experience using tools such as Python, R and QGIS for geography analysis will be very beneficial.

To summarise, here are some bullet points listing some of the qualities we are looking for. If you are in any doubt please get in touch!

Essential

*   Willing to participate and collaborate
*   Using or planning to use quantitative spatial analysis in you research 
*   Familiarity with geographic data and computational methods for working with such data

Nice to have

*  	Experience with Python/Jupyter Notebook or R/RStudio
*   Interesting research project that will benefit from attending the summer school
